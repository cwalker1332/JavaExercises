    Exercise: Write a while loop that continuously reads integers from System.in, until it reads
    and matches a "secret number" from a variable you created and stored within your code.
    Until the "secret number" matches the number entered by the user, the code should print
    "Please try again!", and request a new int from System.in. If the values do match,
    the loop should stop running, and the code should print "You just guessed the secret number!".
